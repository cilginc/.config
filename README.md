# 🛠️ Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal configuration files for my Linux setup.

> ⚠️ **Note**: This repository is a work in progress. Currently, it only includes my `.zshrc` configuration, but more configs (e.g. for window managers, terminal, Neovim, and more) will be added over time.

## 📁 Current Configurations

- [`~/.zshrc`](./zsh/zshrc): My Zsh shell configuration.

## 🧩 Planned Additions

- `Neovim`
- `Hyprland`
- `Waybar`
- `Swaync`
- `Wofi`
- `Wlogout`
- `Btop`
- And more configuration

## 🚀 Setup (Zsh only for now)

Clone the repo and copy the file manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cilginc/.config.git
cp .config/zsh/zshrc ~/.zshrc
```

You also need to install `fzf` and `eza` for better experience.
